# SimplePoll

SimplePoll is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin that allows server admins to put out polls for their players. This plugin is my first actual project and it shows. It doesn't have a lot of functionality, and is horribly orgainzed. One day I plan on redoing this whole project because I like the idea.
